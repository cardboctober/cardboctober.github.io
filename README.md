# Cardboctober

Each day in October we're making something for Google Cardboard.

If you want to keep up with what we're doing, follow [@cardboctober](https://twitter.com/cardboctober) on Twitter, star this repository and check back daily to see how we're getting on!

## Contributing

Cardboctober is open for anybody to join in.

You don't have to participate every day like Max and Ben do.

If you've made something for Google Cardboard, that can be used directly on the web, feel free to edit [_data/hacks.yml](https://github.com/cardboctober/cardboctober.github.io/edit/master/_data/hacks.yml) and send a pull request for us to add it to the list!

The structure of your edit should be as follows:

```yml
- date: 01-10-2016 # (dd-mm-yyyy)
  title: # (e.g. Basic VR)
  url: # (e.g. https://cardboctober.github.io/max/01/)
  blog_url: # (Optional e.g. https://blog.omgmog.net/post/cardboctober-01/)
  img: img/max-01.png # (Optional, either full url, or file in img directory)
  by: # (Github username only, e.g. omgmog)
```
